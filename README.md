## Hints & Solutions üí°

If you get stuck on a level, take a look at [Baba Is Hint](https://www.keyofw.com/baba-is-hint), which aims to give hints as spoiler-free as possible.

Check out the [Baba Is You Wiki](https://babaiswiki.fandom.com/wiki/Baba_Is_You_Wiki). It contains solutions for all levels and explains exactly how all rule blocks work.

## Build Your Own Levels üõ†Ô∏è

The game is compatible with the Morph Halo: Blocks can be duplicated, deleted and moved via the Halo. Combined with the `Playground` level (which contains all implemented blocks) this feature can be used for level prototyping and experimenting.
